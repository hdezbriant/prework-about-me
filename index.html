      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am an aspiring developer with a background in Biotechnology, and
        I hope to someday find my niche through coding and programming. I grew up
        with computers and am looking forward to gaining a more complete familiarity
        with them and, in turn, technology as a whole!
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From:</h1>
      <p>Los Angeles, California</p>
      <h1>My favorite hobbies:</h1>
      <p>Astronomy, playing video games, macro photography, and reading.</p>
      <h1>My dream job:</h1>
      <p>My dying wish is still to explore space, so I have to say Astronaut.
        Or maybe space pirate. Hmm...</p>
      <h1>Where I live:</h1>
      <p>San Diego, California<br>
        United States of America<br>
        Planet Earth, Milky Way Galaxy
      </p>
      <h1>"Why do you want to be a web developer?"</h1>
      <p>As a kid, I wanted to design and program video games. I grew up playing a lot
        and learning about computers and using them almost daily. That naturally led
        to learning about coding and programming, and here I am! I would love to be able 
        to work in a field that helps people on a large scale just by optimizing and
        improving currently existing technology, as well as developing new methods
        to streamline processes we all use every day.
